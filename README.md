# Integration Order Status

This POC demonstrates how you can integrate Order Status in EPCC order from a generic ERP.

## How to use locally

When running this example locally it's recommended you use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to tunnel your dev
environment to the outside world.

Once you have the repo running locally, you'll want to add the integration via
the [Moltin Dashboard](https://dashboard.moltin.com/app/settings/integrations). The `URL` will be the one provided by
ngrok.

### 1. Download the POC

Clone the repository:

```bash
https://github.com/PasqualeMoramarco/EPCC-Integration.git
```

### 2. Configure Flows

Moltin provides you the ability to extend core resources with the Flows feature. Go to
the [Moltin Dashboard](https://dashboard.moltin.com/app/settings/flows) and navigate to `Settings > Flows`.

Here you will want to create a new Flow (or edit if it already exists) for extending Orders. Give it a name and
description you will recognise, but **make sure** the `slug` is set to `orders`.

Next you will want to create a new Field for the Flow you just created.

Give the new Field a name and description you will recognise. **Make sure** the `slug` is set to `status_erp` as this is
what the serverless function expects.

Save this Field

### 3. Start the server and ngrok

Start the development server

The server will typically start on PORT `60000`, if not, make a note for the next step.

Start ngrok

```bash
ngrok http localhost:60000
```

This will expose PORT `60000` to the outside world. Make a note of the `http` URL ngrok provides.

### 4. Start database

Run docker-compose.yml in the repository.

Create table:
```bash
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id varchar(40) NOT NULL,
    status_erp varchar(40) NULL,
    status varchar(40) NULL,
    payment varchar(40) NULL,
    shipping varchar(40) NULL,
    CONSTRAINT orders_pkey PRIMARY KEY (order_id)
);
```

### 5. Create a new Moltin integration

You must now tell Moltin the ngrok URL above. Head to
the [Moltin Dashboard](https://dashboard.moltin.com/app/settings/integrations), login and go
to `Settings > Integrations` and click `Create`.

Enter a name and description for your Integration.

Next, enter the `URL` generated by `ngrok`.

Now finally you'll want to configure when this webhook will be invoked, in this example check the `Order` => `Created` box.

That's it! Click Save

### 6. Download Postman collection

- [Collection](https://documentation.elasticpath.com/assets/epcc/postman/collection.json)

- [Enviroment](https://documentation.elasticpath.com/assets/epcc/postman/environment.json)

### 7. Authenticate

Requests to Commerce Cloud require an Authorization header containing your Bearer token. There are two token types;
implicit and client_credentials.

This guide uses the client_credentials grant type.

Get your API keys Head to the Dashboard, sign in, select your project, and make a copy of your Client ID and Client
secret.

**Get an access token**

Send POST request: `Get client credential token`.

A successful request responds with something similar to:

```bash
{
    "expires": 1608306461,
    "access_token": "7562c99c854f6d355c078ab0e5ad7c6ddbc058c5",
    "identifier": "client_credentials",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

Now youʼll want to make a copy of your access_token. This is your Bearer token that is required for future requests.

### 8. Get a Cart

Letʼs go ahead and request a new Cart. Weʼll use the unique reference `abc` for the
Cart. Weʼll need this when requesting the items, adding items and checking out.

Send GET request: `Get a cart`.

Youʼll receive a response similar to:

```bash
{
  "data": {
    "id": "abc",
    "type": "cart",
    "state": "NY",
    "country": null,
    "zipcode": null,
    "name": "Cart",
    "description": "",
    "links": {
      "self": "https://api.moltin.com/v2/carts/abc"
    },
    "meta": {
      "display_price": {
        "with_tax": {
          "amount": 129900,
          "currency": "EUR",
          "formatted": "€1,299.00"
        },
        "without_tax": {
          "amount": 129900,
          "currency": "EUR",
          "formatted": "€1,299.00"
        },
        "tax": {
          "amount": 0,
          "currency": "EUR",
          "formatted": "€0.00"
        }
      },
      "timestamps": {
        "created_at": "2020-12-02T19:47:44Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-12-18T14:47:59Z"
      }
    },
    "relationships": {
      "items": {
        "data": [
          {
            "type": "custom_item",
            "id": "18f7cdbf-2c21-4f42-b904-990a93e33afb"
          },
          {
            "type": "cart_item",
            "id": "050d06e7-87c7-4def-b68d-9c32ec93199b"
          }
        ]
      },
      "customers": {
        "data": [
          {
            "type": "customer",
            "id": "62796c51-0797-4058-98ed-f0cf4bc4e081"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Now that we have successfully authenticated and retrieved a Cart, now we add a custom item to the Cart.

### 9. Add to Cart

Letʼs go ahead and add a custom_item to the Cart. We are using the same cart reference `abc`.

Send POST request: `Add product to cart`.

Now we have items in the cart, now we convert the Cart to an unpaid Order using the /checkout endpoint.

### 10. Check out a Cart

You can check out a Cart using an existing Customer ID or an object including the customer name and email. In the
following example, weʼll provide a name and an email, as we have no customers yet.

Along with the customers information, we must also provide the billing and shipping information.

Send POST request: `Checkout as costumer`.

When the request is complete, youʼll receive a 201 CREATED response.

Whit this request also the observe Order.created is been trigger. In our local database we can find the order that we
have just created. Our service update the attribute status_erp. 
We can see it by doing this request:

Send GET request: `Get an order` using the order_id what we have created before.

Youʼll receive a response similar to:

```bash

          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 11. Update Status by ERP

We can simulate that the status of the order change. ERP communicate us that the order is delivered.

Sobstitute order_id with the order_id that we have created before. Send GET
request: `http://127.0.0.1:60000/order/updateStatusErp/order_id/status/2-delivered`

Youʼll receive a response similar to:

```bash

      "line2": ""
    }
  }
}
```

Our service update the attribute status_erp. We can see it by doing this request:

Send GET request: `Get an order` using the order_id what we have created before.

That's it!
